# Week-6: Penetration Testing Documentation  
**Using Metasploit Framework on a Vulnerable Environment**

---

## 📌 Overview
This documentation demonstrates the process of performing penetration testing using the **Metasploit Framework** against a vulnerable machine. The goal is to simulate a real-world exploitation scenario, identify vulnerabilities, exploit them, and perform basic post-exploitation activities.

---

## ⚙️ Environment Setup
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux (with Metasploit pre-installed)  
- **Target Machine**: Vulnerable virtual machine (e.g., Windows XP SP3, Metasploitable2)  
- Both systems should be configured in the same virtual network for communication.

## 🔍 Reconnaissance & Scanning
### Step 1: Network Discovery  
Use `nmap` to identify open ports and services.  

```bash
nmap -sS -sV <target_ip>
